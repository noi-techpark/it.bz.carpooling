  title: A solution for sustainable mobility in South Tyrolean companies
  content: In the scope of the EU-project MENTOR, new different smart mobility services were launched in order to start creating a sustainable alternative to private car. One of these services is a new car pooling service, that has been launched in cooperation with the company ummadum. The innovative aspect is the possibility for users to earn points that can be used to purchase local products and services.

  title: "Buy and distribute a mobility budget in your community"
  content: "As an organization you can buy a mobility budget and distribute it in the members of your community (e.g. your company) in a flexible way. These members can then transform this budget in “ummadum points” by moving sustainably, i.e. walking, cycling or making car pooling. The “ummadum points” can be finally used to purchase products / services by local retailers."

faq:
  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  accordion:
    - question: How does the assignment of the mobility budget to employees work?
      answer: Each organisation can manage this process itself via a web-based dashboard that is also made available to monitor the results of system utilisation. These details are discussed and explored in detail with ummadum during the process of system configuration according to the organisation's needs.
    - question: Does the system allow to certify movements of users?
      answer: The walking, cycling and carpooling trips are certified thanks to an automatic monitoring mechanism based on the GPS signal on the smartphone. This monitoring is only functional to verify the execution of a trip: after this control, the GPS positions of the users are deleted.
